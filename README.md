# YelpCamp
A full stack web application project from the Udemy course - The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele

YelpCamp is a website where users can create and review campgrounds. In order to review or create a campground, you must have an account. Built on a MongoDB/Express/Node stack, utilizing RESTful architecture with the Bootstrap 4 CSS framework for styling. Passport.js was used to handle authentication.

The app performs CRUD operations for users, the campground and the comments. These pieces are referenced within the database through various associations. Actionable commands are displayed dynamically on the site (edit/delete) for campground and comments, depending on a userâ€™s authorization/ownership. Flash messages handle error and success messages to provide the visitor with feedback.
